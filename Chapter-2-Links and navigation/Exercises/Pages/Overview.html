           <!--Summary about the movie-->
<div class="p11">
    <p>The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the dragon's mercy.</p>
</div>
<div class="p2">
    <p>Centuries later, a teenage girl, Elodie, daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage to help their impoverished people, and she and her family sail to Aurea. Upon meeting, Elodie and Henry initially both seem uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. Elodie’s stepmother, Lady Bayford, seeks out Queen Isabelle, hoping to strengthen their familial bond, but Isabelle rebuffs attempts to become acquainted, leading Lady Bayford to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement.</p>
</div>
<div class="p3">
    <p>After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. Isabelle, dressed as a priestess, describes the pact between the first king and the dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters for peace. Following a ceremony where their hands are cut and held together, Henry insists on carrying Elodie across the narrow path over the dragon's lair, then throws her into the chasm.</p>
</div>
<div class="p4">
    <p>Elodie recovers from the fall, realizing that she is the actual sacrifice. While finding a way out, the dragon enters the lair and taunts her before chasing Elodie and burning her leg. After escaping the beast, Elodie discovers an illuminated cave with glowing slugs, which she collects as a light source. The dragon finds her again. Upon fleeing, Elodie reaches a chamber with the note "Safe Here She Cannot Reach," the names of past victims and a map carved into the wall. While Elodie is asleep, the glowing slugs heal the burn on her leg.</p>
</div>
<div class="p5">
    <p>Elodie follows the map, but it leads to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, providing the reason for the royal sacrifices. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. The dragon kills them all, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit.</p>
</div>
<div class="p6">
    <p>The conflagration alerts Isabelle that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, forcing her to kidnap Elodie's younger sister, Floria, as a replacement. After Lady Bayford rides out and informs her, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who is left alive as bait.</p>
</div>
<div class="p7">
    <p>Elodie creates a diversion for the dragon to reach Floria. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, deceiving the dragon that the sacrificed princesses were Aurean royalty. The dragon refuses to believe Elodie, stating that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. With the dragon at her mercy, she heals both of them with the glowing slugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="p8">
    <p>Elodie then interrupts another wedding at the palace, exposing the Aureans' treachery. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the dragon.</p>
