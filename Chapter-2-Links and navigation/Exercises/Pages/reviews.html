     <h5>★★★★★</h5>
    <p>If I could, I would seriously give this movie even more stars, likes, reviews and so on and on!!!! Even when the trailer released, I immediately knew this movie would be FIRE!!! And so, so, wonderful, emotional, mesmerizing, breathtaking and just amazing!!! Even the characters, their expressions, feelings, emotions were so beautifully done, I literally felt it all through myself. The ending I was hoping for and waiting for happened and I was so happy for it to end the way I interpreted it to be.</p>
    
    <div class="Damsel">"Damsel" is a unique fairy tale movie that breaks away from the typical storyline of a Prince charming coming to the rescue. As a fantasy movie and a Netflix production, it caught my attention. The teaser trailer that was released last year piqued my interest, as it promised an exciting adventure with clever and memorable scenes.</div>

    <p>As this was a Netflix movie, I activated my woke goggles as I turned it on and yup, bad guys were white and there was representation from different ethnicities. I do appreciate diversity in film scripts and here it is done in a way that didn’t feel like it was done to fill a quota, but actually by talent so that was nice.

      I made a prediction of how things were gonna go with how movies trends are generally these days in fantasy stories that give you that twist, such as in Disney’s Malevolent, and sure enough we get the same trope here. People = bad, doing bad stuff, and the perceived bad guys are actually misunderstood.
      
      What saved this movie is Millie Bobby Brown, Robin Wright and that amazingly animated dragon. Without them this movie would have fallen apart easily, so it was great to see some great acting and voice acting to help make this movie come together. It is just a shame how it is so predictable, and the massive plot convenience of magical healing glow worms just had me going “what?” Watch it to see what I mean, it just removed the tension from the movie.
      
      Overall, an okay movie, easily 6/10 but it could have been more as it had so much potential.</p>

    <p>According to Netflix, in the first three days the film recorded 35.3 million views and placed number one in 79 countries.<br>
      [16][17] It also had 64.8 hours viewed within the same time period, over three times more than what Code 8: Part II and Spaceman got in their second week of streaming.[17]</p>
